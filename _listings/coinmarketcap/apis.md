- name: CoinMarketCap Professional API Documentation - Get market quotes (historical)
  x-api-slug: v1exchangequoteshistorical-get
  description: |-
    Returns an interval of historic quotes for any exchange based on time and interval parameters.

    Historical exchange quotes currently include:
    volume_24: Combined 24 hour volume for all market pairs at each historical interval.
    num_market_pairs: Number of market pairs available at each historical interval.
    Quotes are returned in USD. Additional currency conversion options and additional fields will be available in the future.

    **Technical Details**
    A historic quote for every "interval" period between your "time_start" and "time_end" will be returned.
    If a "time_start" is not supplied, the "interval" will be applied in reverse from "time_end".
    If "time_end" is not supplied, it defaults to the current time.
    At each "interval" period, the historic quote that is closest in time to the requested time will be returned.
    If no historic quotes are available in a given "interval" period up until the next interval period, it will be skipped.

    **Interval Options**
    There are 2 types of time interval formats that may be used for "interval".

    The first are calendar year and time constants in UTC time:
    **"hourly"** - Get the first quote available at the beginning of each calendar hour.
    **"daily"** - Get the first quote available at the beginning of each calendar day.
    **"weekly"** - Get the first quote available at the beginning of each calendar week.
    **"monthly"** - Get the first quote available at the beginning of each calendar month.
    **"yearly"** - Get the first quote available at the beginning of each calendar year.

    The second are relative time intervals.
    **"m"**: Get the first quote available every "m" minutes (60 second intervals). Supported minutes are: "5m", "10m", "15m", "30m", "45m".
    **"h"**: Get the first quote available every "h" hours (3600 second intervals). Supported hour intervals are: "1h", "2h", "3h", "6h", "12h".
